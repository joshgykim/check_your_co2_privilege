# **Check Your CO2 Privilege**

[Live Demo](https://joshgykim.github.io/check_your_co2_privilege/)

### **Overview**

Preventing a climate crisis is as much a geopolitical and social issue as it is an environmental issue. The problems we face are fundamentally interdependent on one another and therefore must be addressed as such. "Check Your CO2 Privilege!" is a project that helps us estimate our very own carbon footprint based on our income level and visualize what it means in the global context. We will be able to see how our carbon habits compare to those with different cultural backgrounds, such as nationality and socioeconomic status. What would the world look like if everyone emitted the same level of CO2 as us? What can we do to fight carbon inequality? The intent of this project is to not only educate but also encourgage the users to work together in dealing with this global threat.

In "Check Your CO2 Privilege!", users will be able to:

- Estimate their carbon footprint upon inputting their geographical location and income level
- Interact with a breakdown of their estimate
- Visually compare the world today with one with total carbon equality
- Interact with each country to see a breakdown of their CO2 data
- Toggle a carbon intensive habit (e.g. commuting by car) to see how it affects the world

In addition, this project will include:
- An instruction for manipulating the data
- This README!

### **Technologies, Libraries, APIs**

[Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data) - Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country with detailed breakdown

[ClimateWatch API](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&historical-emissions-gases=All%20Selected%2Cco2&historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&historical-emissions-sectors=total-including-lucf&page=1) - Historical Emisions by Country, Continent, and Income Group

[CoolClimate Calculator](https://api-central.berkeley.edu/api/11) **(PENDING)** - Carbon Calculator API based on location, income, household size

[D3.js](https://d3js.org) - Data Visualization Tool

### **Implementation Timeline**

- 09/03 Friday: In-depth API research, confirming & testing data availability. Get familar and setting up project architecture.
- 09/04 Saturday: In-depth wireframing in conjunction with learning D3.js. Create carbon calculator.
- 09/05 Sunday: Create visualization of the world's carbon emission. Brainstorm ways in which calculator can manipulate the data.
- 09/06 Monday: Make the visualizations interact with one another.
- 09/07 Tuesday: Continue. Work on HTML & CSS.
- 09/08 Wednesday: Work on UI and graphic elements. Implement animations if possible.
- 09/09 Thursday: Minor touch-up/last minute visual adjustments.
